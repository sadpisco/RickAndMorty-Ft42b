The Rick and Morty Project

This project was born as my first FullStack Web Software to graduate as developer. On this page you can perform multiple interactive searches to a database powered by The Rick and Morty API. You are able to consult general information about the series from season 1 to 5. Likewise, you can consult general information about each character, episode and location. Each entity has its own table developed in PostgresSQL, which are intertwined and the page allows queries of these relationships. In addition to this, it is possible to create your own character and upload it to the database to later consult it. Please create your own character and register it in the program.
